# Installation

## Starter Kit

This is our recommended way to install butik. 

With this starter kit we did much more then just setting up _butik_ for you. We also created a complete layout ready for you to use. It has been our focus to make it aesthetically pleasing and if needed easily adaptable to change according to your needs. 

Feel free to use the preset design exactly as it is, just tweak a few things or rebuild all templates from scratch in accordance with your own tastes.

## Individual Set-Up 

If you want to integrate _butik_ into an existing project, you can do so by manual selection during the installation. 

Decide if you want to use something different than SQLite \(maybe MySQL is already in use?\), redefine all templates, simply work with your preferences.
