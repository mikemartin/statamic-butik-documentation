# Installation

## Starter Kit

This is our recommended way to install butik. 

With this starter kit we did much more then only setting up _butik_ for you. We also did build a complete layout ready for you. It has been our focus to make it look beautiful, but easy adaptable after your needs. 

Feel free to use the given design exactly as it is, tweak a few things if you like or rebuild all templates after your needs. 

{% page-ref page="starter-kit.md" %}

## Manual 

Especially if you want to integrate _butik_ into an existing project, you can do so. 

Decide if you want to use something different then SQLite \(maybe MySQL is already in use?\), redefine all templates or whatever you need.
