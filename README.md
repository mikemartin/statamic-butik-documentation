# License 

Before going into productions with *Statamic Butik*, you need to buy a license at the Statamic Marketplace. 

*Statamic Butik* is not free software. 

# Beta

"Butik" is an addon for Statamic v3, which is in beta right now. Until Statamic v3 is in beta, you **should be careful to use Butik in production. There can be breaking changes!**

## Stability

The actual version is backed up by **183 PHPUnit tests** with **473 assertions** to check if things are working as expected. 

With Butik it's my highest goal to provide a stable and fun to use e-commerce solution, build with a Scandinavian mindset:
Starting as simple as possible with the most stable foundation, to continue from there. Said so, keep in touch about the newest updates.
