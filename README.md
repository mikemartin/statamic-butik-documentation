## A Statamic e-commerce solution

![Statamic 3.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statamic-3.0+-FF269E?style=for-the-badge&link=https://statamic.com) [![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://packagist.org/packages/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik)

_**butik**_ is a Scandinavian term for a small to medium sized shop, precisely what this Statamic addon has been crafted for. The _Statamic Butik_ e-commerce solution will integrate nicely with your personal Statamic site and help to grow your online business.

You can use the light and simple design as shipped or customize it after your needs, to integrate it perfectly into your existing design.

## Beta

_butik_ is an addon for Statamic v3, which is in beta right now. Until Statamic v3 is in beta, you **should be careful to use Butik in production. There can be breaking changes!**

### Stability

The actual version is backed up by **350 PHPUnit tests** with **676 assertions** to check if things are working as expected.

With Butik it's my highest goal to provide a stable and fun to use e-commerce solution, build with a Scandinavian mindset: Starting as simple as possible with the most stable foundation, to continue from there. Said so, keep in touch about the newest updates.
