## A Statamic e-commerce solution

![Statamic 3.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statamic-3.0+-FF269E?style=for-the-badge&link=https://statamic.com) [![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://packagist.org/packages/jonassiewertsen/statamic-butik)

**butik** is a Scandinavian term for a small to medium-sized [retail shop](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butik), precisely what this Statamic add-on has been designed for. 

The _Statamic Butik_ e-commerce solution will work great together with your personal Statamic site and will help you expand your online business. You can use the Butik Starter Kit's clean & modern design or fully customize the design to match your branding.

## Beta

_butik_ is an add-on for Statamic v3, which is currently in its beta phase. As long as Statamic v3 is in beta, you **should keep in mind that major changes during the development could lead to malfunctions in** _**Butik**_  **which we supervise and fix as soon as possible.**

### Stability

The current version is backed up by **350 PHPUnit tests** with **676 assertions** to monitor if things are working as expected.

When creating _Butik_ my highest goal was to provide a well functioning and fun to use e-commerce solution. _Butik_ is modeled after a Scandinavian mindset: starting as simple as possible with a solid foundation to continue from there on. Figuratively speaking: always keep in touch about the latest updates for the best user experience.
