# Countries

## Getting you started

Before you can sell products, you need to set up **at least one country**. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/countries.png)

We did set up one default country through the installation process, which should get you started. 

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you did set up butik manually, you can easily edit your countries in the  settings
{% endhint %}

### Countries will define which countries you can ship to

![](../.gitbook/assets/countries-menu.png)

Create all the countries, you would like to sell your products to.  When setting up your shipping zones, it will be possible to connect your countries to them. 

If you want to ship to a specific country, make sure you did create the country.
