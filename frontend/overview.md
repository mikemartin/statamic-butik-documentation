# Overview

_butik_ has been crafted with a default design, so that every user has a great foundation to start from. 

No starting from scratch every time, no need to set up everything on your own.   
Just get started!

## Customization

We are trying to find the perfect balance between »well working« and »fully customizable«. 

Said so, we have prepared a lot of boilerplate which can be easily shared. 

## Starter Kit

Our provided Starter Kit offers a great possibility to get started. 

{% page-ref page="../installation/installation/starter-kit.md" %}

## Implement CSS

{% hint style="info" %}
Not needed, if you are using our Starter Kit.
{% endhint %}

If you want to use our preset design, go ahead. We would be pleased to hear that others are enjoying it as much as we do.

We created it with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You can either compile it yourself via Tailwind or use our css file as a standalone solution.

### Use compiled CSS file

You can copy our compiled CSS file into the `<head>` section of your layout file. That's all you have to do.

```text
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/vendor/butik/css/statamic-butik.css">
```

### Compile it yourself

Take a look at our Starter Kit and how we set it up. It's a basic Tailwind CSS set up, as you know it from [Statamic](www.Statamic.com). 

To recompile, run `npm run production`

## Templates

We offer finished templates for every page, which already have been linked to all needed functions. 

Read this part if you want to know more about the connected functionality.

{% page-ref page="templates/" %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Don't worry, you can adjust every part of our templates.
{% endhint %}

## Antlers Tags

You can use [Antlers](https://statamic.dev/antlers) tags to combine _butik_ perfectly with your page.
